This plugin enables control over which mobs are allowed to spawn. It can be configured to allow spawner eggs to be used, or completely disable spawning of the mob type.

A command(/killmob) is also provided to allow players with permission to kill all mobs of a certain type.

DisableMobs is currently updated with Bukkit 1.6.2-R0.1
